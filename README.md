# Styled Tailwind (React example + TS)

Experimenting with creating [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) 💅 equivalent for [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) 🍃

Or any other maintainable Tailwind solution that doesn't pollute JSX with that many classes

First time trying [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) and it is amazing ❤️ Super fast ⚡
